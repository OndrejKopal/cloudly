<h2>Hello and welcome to the cloud!</h2>

What is Project Cloudly?
<br/>
<br/>
It's a software to monitor and control your servers (both public and private ones).
<br/>
It saves you money and energies by taking away most of the usual servers' monitoring complexities allowing you to focus on control and better use of your infrastructure.
<br/>
<br/>
Cloudly also comes with more than 100+ ready to use professionally configured software packages and allows you to deploy these quickly in the cloud.
<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy! :)
