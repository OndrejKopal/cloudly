    <h2>ProjectCloudly</h2>

    <b>ProjectCloudly is an enterprise grade IT Infrastructure and Applications Monitoring platform developed under the open source model.</b>

    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well, what does that mean?

    <br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Enterprise Grade:</b> It was designed from “day one” to monitor tens of thousands to ultimately unlimited devices with a single instance. It brings the power, scalability and flexibility that enterprises and carriers demand.
    This is achieved thanks to the some of the coolest technologies in the industry (Hadoop, OpenTSDB, Django and such..)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Application Platform:</b> While ProjectCloudly is useful “out of the box”, it is designed to be highly customizable and work with the industry standard Nagios to create an unique and integrated servers monitoring solution.

    <br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Open Source:</b> ProjectCloudly is 100% Free and Open Source software, with no license fees, software subscriptions or special “enterprise” versions.
