    <h2>ProjectCloudly - Smart, Smarter, the Smartest</h2>
    <h4>Saves you money and shitload of resources!</h4>
    <br/>
    <b>ProjectCloudly is an enterprise grade Real-time IT Infrastructure and Applications Monitoring platform developed under the Open Source model.</b>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    Well, what does that mean?
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Enterprise Grade:</b> It was designed from “day one” to monitor tens of thousands to ultimately unlimited devices with a single instance. It brings the power, scalability and flexibility that enterprises and carriers demand.
    This is achieved thanks to the some of the coolest technologies ProjectCloudly utilises (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=hadoop" target="_blank">Hadoop</a>, <a href="http://opentsdb.net" target="_blank">OpenTSDB</a>, <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com" target="_blank">Django</a> and such..)
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Application Platform:</b> While ProjectCloudly is useful “out of the box”, it is designed to be highly customizable and work with the industry standard <a href="https://exchange.nagios.org/directory/Plugins" target="_blank">Nagios Plugins</a> to create an unique and integrated servers monitoring solution.
    It does so fully automatically with very little or no interaction with the terminal prompt.
    
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <b>Open Source:</b> ProjectCloudly is 100% Free and Open Source software, with no license fees, software subscriptions or special “enterprise” versions.
