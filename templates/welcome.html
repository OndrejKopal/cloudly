<h2>Hello and welcome to the cloud!</h2>

What is F*ckmecloudly?
<br/>
<br/>
It's a software to control your Cloud Services (both public, private ones and desktop computing).
<br/>
It saves you money and energies by taking away most of the usual cloud complexities allowing you to focus on control and better use of your infrastructure.
<br/>
<br/>
F*ckmecloudly also comes with more than 100+ ready to use professionally configured software packages and allows you to deploy these quickly on bare metal, virtual machines, or in the cloud.
