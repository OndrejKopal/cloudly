<h2>Hello and welcome to the cloud!</h2>

What is F*ckmecloudly?
<br/>
It's a tool for centralised management of your Cloud Services (both public and private ones).
<br/>
It saves you money and energy by taking away most of the usual cloud complexities allowing you to focus on control and better use of your infrastructure.
<br/>
F*ckmecloudly also comes with more than 100+ ready to use professionally configured software packages and allows you to deploy these quickly on bare metal, virtual machines, or in the cloud. &nbsp; That's another green in your pocket.
<br/>
Enjoy! :)
